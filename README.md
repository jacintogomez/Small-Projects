# Small Python Projects

`removebackground.py` Gives you a cutout png of a person or animal from an image you upload
`dir_struct.py` Prints the structure of a directory with all files in it (good for displaying file system structure of complex projects)
`dir_find.py` Prints the path to a file within a directory
`base-class-function.py` Shows how to create a function that acts also as a class object (was trying to replicate how Celery's Shared Task decorator can be supplied a base function)
